# Search Physical:100 (Netflix)

Search contestants from the [Netflix show Physical:100](https://www.netflix.com/no-en/title/81587446).

<small>**Note:** I do not own the rights to neither the logo or the images. If you're Netflix and want me to remove them, please reach out.</small>

## Roadmap

- [x] Add contestant avatars/images
  - [ ] Add alternative card list format
- [ ] Add support for updating/editing contestant information. Ideally this would be a community effort...
  - [ ] Add support for more data points per contestant?
- [ ] Add support for showing when people are eliminated (and what episode?)
