# Product developer &&nbsp;wannabe designer

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [@rix1](https://twitter.com/rix1), an Oslo-based
[product developer](https://github.com/rix1) and engineering manager with a
passion for music and dogs.

Born in the Nordics in 1990 and raised amidst a lively pack of siblings, I'm on
a quest to make sense of the world through the lens of products, technology, and
design. I take pride in _creating_ things for a living, both on the computer and
in the kitchen âœ¨

I'm here to learn all the things and build a better tomorrow tomorrow doing so.
You can read more [about me](/about) or check out my [my writing](/posts).

I'm currently having fun chasing the sun together with
