# Product developer & wannabe designer

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [@rix1](https://twitter.com/rix1), an Oslo-based [product
developer](https://github.com/rix1) and engineering manager with a passion for music and dogs.

Born in the Nordics in 1990 and raised amidst a lively pack of siblings, I'm on a quest to make sense of the world through the lens of products, technology, and design. I take pride in _creating_ things for a living, both on the computer or in the kitchen âœ¨ Check out some of my creations below.

I'm here to learn all the things and build a better tomorrow tomorrow doing so. I strive to capture this in [my writing](/posts).

I'm currently having fun chasing the sun together with
