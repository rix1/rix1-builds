# Product developer &&nbsp;wannabe designer

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [@rix1](https://twitter.com/rix1), an Oslo-based
[product developer](https://github.com/rix1) and engineering manager with a
passion for music and dogs.

Born in Norway and raised amidst a lively <span title="Six siblings to be exact">pack</span> of siblings, I'm on
a quest to make sense of the world through the lens of products, technology, and
design. I take pride in _creating_ things, both on the computer and
in the kitchen âœ¨

I'm here to learn all the things and build a better tomorrow tomorrow doing so.
While I work on getting my blog migrated, you can read more [about me here](/about).

I'm currently having fun chasing the sun together with
