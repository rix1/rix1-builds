I've found my home in product community of Oslo, in the intersection of technology, design, and sustainable energy solutions. After I joined [Otovo](https://otovo.com/) as their fourth engineer, I've helped grow the company from a small team to where we are today. We have installed solar power in tens of thousands of homes across 13 European countries. And we're [not done](https://twitter.com/rix1/status/1688663122385457153) yet.

Life's path is never straight. During my informatics studies at NTNU in Trondheim, [my partner](https://github.com/sirihol) and I spent a year on exchange at UCT in Cape Town. When we werenâ€™t studying, visiting vineyards or at the beach, I worked for a Norwegian startup, [CosyTech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cosytech). We [won a few competitions](https://twitter.com/Torildnm/status/617090179862523908), but never found product-market fit. No customers means no revenue, so we decided to close down after 10 months. [Andrroy](https://github.com/andrroy) and I proceeded to freelance together for the remainder of our formal studies.

An unexpected turn of events while writing my [master's thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2403242), lead me to cancel my contract with [BEKK](https://www.bekk.no/), where I was supposed to start as a full-time consultant later that year. Instead, I accepted an offer from [DNB](https://www.dnb.no/), Norway's largest bank. This was thanks to <s>productive procrastination</s> a hackathon that [went surprisingly well](https://www.dnb.no/dnbnyheter/no/din-okonomi/dnb-utfordrer-studenter-til-a-vise-seg-frem).

I was a bit hesitant to joining such a large organisation, so the folks at DNB convinced us to spend two weeks at the bank. It was an exciting experience where we started what eventually would morph into their [Open Banking platform](https://developer.dnb.no/). However exciting, my feets were still a bit cold. After a lot of back and forth, I ended up cancelling my second contract in just 3 weeks.

That morning, I walked back into the office of a client I had been working with for the past 6 months â€“ the newly [founded solar startup Otovo](https://www.dn.no/solenergi/grunder/energi/selger-teslaen-for-a-folge-i-elon-musks-fotspor/1-1-5560478).
Surprised to see me, I asked them if I could start full-time.

After a quick meeting with Simen and Andreas, I signed a contract for a full-time engineering position with Otovo. 2016 was a crazy year. Now, over eight years later, I'm still having fun chasing the sun together with Otovo from our [office in Torggata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVtntdVEEdDjDazK7).

These experiences were never strategic career moves. For me, they were lessons in navigating uncertainty, adaptability and placing bets on people.

Away from the <kbd>keyboard</kbd>, I love cooking â€“ ideally for larger crowds - as I come from a big family. I have fun when I can be curious, have attention to detail, do _just enoughâ„¢_ planning and focus on <mark>playful execution</mark>.

I'm definitively a dog person, as I've had two Belgian shepherds since 2007. In addition to providing unconditional love, they have been, and still are a daily reminder that patience and training go a long way.

Life is better with music, which is why I listen to it [pretty much all day](https://www.last.fm/user/rikardeide). Long distance running and tap dancing are my go-to activities for a mental and physical balance.

In conclusion, I approach work as I do life\* with a blend of ambition, inspiration and a hands-on attitude. Whether I'm leading product people at Otovo, planning missions as a squad leader in the [Norwegian Army Reserves](https://www.forsvaret.no/heimevernet) or cooking for children at [Feriekolonien](https://www.feriekolonien.no/), I like mixing theory and practice. I care about about making an impact, not just making noise.

<small>\*I don't think about it differently to be honest</small>

That should do it for now. If you still haven't gotten enough, [here's some content](https://rix1-dev.vercel.app/posts) from my old site that still haven't been ported.
