Hi, I'm Rikard. Based in the product community of Oslo, I've carved out a niche
where technology, design, and sustainability meet. As the fourth engineer at
[Otovo](https://otovo.com/), I've been part of an incredible journey - scaling the company from
less than 10 colleagues to tens of thousands of PV installations across 13
European markets. _And we're not done yet._

As most things in life, this path wasn't always straightforward. During my
informatics degree at NTNU in Trondheim, I moved to Cape Town for a year where I
attended UCT. While there, I joined a [Norwegian startup
remotely](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cosytech). We [won several
competitions](https://twitter.com/Torildnm/status/617090179862523908), but no
customers. No customers means no revenue, so after ~10 months we decided to
close shop. I then started working freelance with
[Andrroy](https://github.com/andrroy) next to my final year of studies. An
unexpected turn while writing my [masters in ambulatory patient
monitoring](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2403242), lead me
to resign from my upcoming consultant job at [BEKK](https://www.bekk.no/) in
favour of accepting an offer from [DNB](https://www.dnb.no/), Norway's largest
bank. This was thanks to <s>productive procastination</s> participating in
hackathon that [went surprisingly
well](https://www.dnb.no/dnbnyheter/no/din-okonomi/dnb-utfordrer-studenter-til-a-vise-seg-frem).

I worked two exciting weeks at the bank, but unfortunately for them, I had an
abdundance of job opportunities. So in yet another twist I went back to a former
client, the newly [founded solar startup Otovo](https://www.dn.no/solenergi/grunder/energi/selger-teslaen-for-a-folge-i-elon-musks-fotspor/1-1-5560478) and asked if they wanted me to
join full time. 2016 was a crazy year. Now, more than 8 years later, I'm still
having fun chasing the sun at our office in Torggata.

These experiences were never strategic career moves; they were lessons in
navigating uncertainty, adaptability and the importance of team effort.

Away from the <kbd>keyboard</kbd>, I'm geek out in the kitchen, tackling the
challenge of cooking for a crowd with the same energy and organization I bring
to my professional projects. I've been lucky enough to raise two Belgian
shepherds that have kept me on my toes for the last 15+ years. They are a daily
reminder me that patience and training go a long way, both in life and work.

I approach work as I do life\* with a blend of ambition, inspiration and a
hands-on attitude. Whether it's about leading people at Otovo, cooking for children at [Feriekolonien](https://www.feriekolonien.no/) applying theory
from my master's in informatics, or embracing self-taught design principles,
it's about making an impact, not just making noise.

\*<small>I don't really think about it differently TBH</small>

My life's soundtrack varies from jazz to post-rock, with an interesting anecdote
of sharing the stage with Michael Jackson at a young age. Long distance running
and tap dancing are my go-to activities for a mental and physical balance,
reflecting my belief in well-roundedness. And yes, being one of seven siblings
does add its own flavor to my life story.

Welcome to my page, where I share snippets of a journey that's as much about
teamwork and continuous learning as it is about embracing the unexpected turns.
