I've found my home in product community of Oslo, in the intersection of technology, design, and sustainable energy solutions. After I joined [Otovo](https://otovo.com/) as their fourth engineer, I've helped grow the company from a small team to where we are today. We have installed solar power in tens of thousands of homes across 13 European countries. And we're [not done](https://twitter.com/rix1/status/1688663122385457153) yet.

Life's path is never straight. During my informatics studies at NTNU in Trondheim, [my partner](https://github.com/sirihol) and I spent a year on exchange at UCT in Cape Town. When we werenâ€™t studying, visiting vineyards or at the beach, I worked for a Norwegian startup, [CosyTech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cosytech). We [won a few competitions](https://twitter.com/Torildnm/status/617090179862523908), but never found product-market fit. No customers means no revenue, so we decided to close down after 10 months. [Andrroy](https://github.com/andrroy) and I proceeded to freelance together for the remainder of our formal studies.

An unexpected turn of events while writing my [master's thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2403242), lead me to cancel my contract with [BEKK](https://www.bekk.no/), where I was supposed to start as a full-time consultant later that year. Instead, I accepted an offer from [DNB](https://www.dnb.no/), Norway's largest bank. This was thanks to <s>productive procrastination</s> a hackathon that [went surprisingly well](https://www.dnb.no/dnbnyheter/no/din-okonomi/dnb-utfordrer-studenter-til-a-vise-seg-frem).

I was a bit hesitant to joining such a large organisation, but the folks at DNB convinced us to spend two weeks at the bank to get a feel for it. It was an exciting experience; we started what eventually would morph into their [Open Banking platform](https://developer.dnb.no/). However, my feets were still a bit cold. After a lot of back and forth, I ended up cancelling my second contract in just 3 weeks.

That morning, I walked back into the office of a client I had been working with for the past 6 months â€“ the newly [founded solar startup, Otovo](https://www.dn.no/solenergi/grunder/energi/selger-teslaen-for-a-folge-i-elon-musks-fotspor/1-1-5560478). Although they were surprised to see me, they got really excited when I asked if I could get a full-time job.

After a quick meeting with [Simen](https://twitter.com/simenfur) and [Andreas](https://twitter.com/athornor), I signed a contract for a engineering position with Otovo. 2016 was a crazy year. Now, over eight years and countless experiences later, I'm still having fun chasing the sun together with Otovo from our [office in Torggata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVtntdVEEdDjDazK7).

These experiences were never strategic career moves for me. They were lessons in navigating uncertainty and the importance of having fun while placing bets on who to surround yourself with.

Away from the <kbd>keyboard</kbd>, I love cooking. Ideally for larger crowds - as I come from a big family. I have fun when I can be curious, have attention to detail, do _just enoughâ„¢_ planning and focus on <mark>playful execution</mark>.

I'm definitively a dog person, as I've had two Belgian shepherds since 2007. Dogs are pretty great. They not only provide unconditional love, but are also a daily reminder that patience, commitment and consistency go a long way.

Life is better with music, which is why I listen to it [pretty much all day](https://www.last.fm/user/rikardeide). Long distance running and tap dancing are my go-to activities for a mental and physical balance.

In conclusion, I approach work as I do life\* â€“ with a blend of ambition, inspiration and a hands-on attitude. Whether I'm leading product people at Otovo, planning a mission as a squad leader in the [Norwegian Army Reserves](https://www.forsvaret.no/heimevernet) or cooking for children at [Feriekolonien](https://www.feriekolonien.no/), I like mixing theory and practice. I care about about making an impact, not just making noise.

<small>\*I don't think about it that differently to be honest</small>

That should do it for now. If you still haven't gotten enough, [here's some content](https://rix1-dev.vercel.app/posts) from my old site that still haven't been ported.

_Cheers - Rix1_
