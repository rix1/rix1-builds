I've found my home in product community of Oslo, in the intersection of technology, design, and sustainable energy solutions. After I joined [Otovo](https://otovo.com/) in 2016 as one of their first employees, I've helped grow the company to where we are today: Hundreds of employees, precence in 13 markets and tens of thousands of homes with solar panels on their roofs
(and we're [not done](https://twitter.com/rix1/status/1688663122385457153) yet).

I come from a life of priviledge, there's no doubt about that. I've probably been given more opportunities than most, but I also believe in making my own luck. I've come to understand that both history and life is only as straight as the stories we tell. So here's mine:

During my informatics studies at NTNU in Trondheim, [my partner](https://www.instagram.com/siriholtnaes/) and I spent a year on exchange at UCT in Cape Town. When we weren‚Äôt studying, visiting vineyards or at the beach, I worked remote for a Norwegian startup, [CosyTech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cosytech). This was my first real job in the world of product. After [winning a few competitions](https://twitter.com/Torildnm/status/617090179862523908), Visa invited us to wine and dine at at their HQ in London ‚Äì a weird but fun trip. CosyTech however, never found product-market fit. No customers meant no revenue, so we decided to close shop after ~12 months.

[Andrroy](https://github.com/andrroy) and I then proceeded to freelance part-time together for the remainder of our formal studies. We built an e-commerce site for [wedding dresses](https://whitestory.no/), we MVP'd an [online learning platform](https://twitter.com/corsane_com), and spent about a year working on a "game" that was played in an [fMRI machine](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.084202v1.abstract) as part of a research project. We had no idea what we were doing back then, but we were good enough that people paid us to play and have fun.

In an unexpected turn of events while writing my [master's thesis](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2403242) lead me to break my upcoming full-time position at [BEKK](https://www.bekk.no/), and accept a job offer from [DNB](https://www.dnb.no/), Norway's largest bank. This was thanks to <s>productive procrastination</s> a hackathon in 2016 that [went surprisingly well](https://www.dnb.no/dnbnyheter/no/din-okonomi/dnb-utfordrer-studenter-til-a-vise-seg-frem).

I was a bit hesitant to joining such a large organisation, but the kind folks at DNB convinced us to spend two weeks at the bank to get a feel for it. It was an exciting experience: We started what eventually would morph into their [Open Banking platform](https://developer.dnb.no/). However fun, my feets were still a bit cold. After a lot of back and forth, I ended up cancelling my second contract in just 3 weeks.

That morning, I walked back into the office of a client Andrroy and I had been working with for the past 6 months ‚Äì the newly [founded solar startup, Otovo](https://www.dn.no/solenergi/grunder/energi/selger-teslaen-for-a-folge-i-elon-musks-fotspor/1-1-5560478). Beliving they had lost me to the bank, [Andreas](https://twitter.com/athornor) and [Simen](https://twitter.com/simenfur) were surprised to see me. The surprise turned into excitement when I asked if I could join full-time. I signed and started my first full-time postition as a software engineer that day, and never looked back.

2016 was a crazy year. Now, eight+ years and countless experiences later, I'm still having fun chasing the sun together with Otovo.

As you might figure, these experiences were never strategic career moves for me. However, I learned some important lessons in:

1. Navigating uncertainty.
2. The importance of having fun.
3. Placing bets on who to surround yourself with.

Away from the <kbd>keyboard</kbd>, I like to cook. Ideally for larger crowds - either for a bunch of kids at [Feriekolonien](https://www.feriekolonien.no/), or for my large family. I have fun when I can be curious, have attention to detail, do _just enough‚Ñ¢_ planning and focus on <mark class="playful">playful execution</mark>.

I think dogs are pretty great. We've had three Belgian shepherds since 2007: [Sam & Tiva](https://s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/rix1.dev/dogs/sam-tiva-bamble.jpg) and most recently [Yoda](https://s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/rix1.dev/dogs/yoda-oslo.jpg) ü´∂. A constant source of unconditional love, but also a daily reminder that patience, commitment and consistency go a long way.

Life is better with music, which is why you'll always find me [listening to it](https://www.last.fm/user/rikardeide). Semi-long distance running and dancing are my go-to activities for keeping in shape.

That should do it for now. If you still haven't gotten enough, [here's some content](https://old.rix1.dev/posts) from my old site that still haven't been ported.

Cheers, Rix1 ‚úåÔ∏è
