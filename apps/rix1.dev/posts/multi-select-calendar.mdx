I made a fully functioning multi-select/date range calendar component, and it
looks like this. Try using it and select a few dates.

<CalendarDemo />

You can select multiple days and it should be somewhat accessible.

### Motivation

I'm building a simple service for my (rather large) family to coordinate different
things (dinner, cabin trips etc). I needed a calendar to select date ranges
to make it easy to answer the following:

1. When are you arriving?
2. When are you leaving?

It's sorta works like Airbnb's calendar picker, except that it doesn't update
the range on `:hover`, only on click. Here's how it's used in the the family
planner:

![Cabin-planner UI demo](https://s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/rix1.dev/screenshots/2022-08-08+calendar+demo.png)

I also plan to use the component to filter data in a list view at a later stage.

### Technical details

All the date stuff relies heavily on [Dayjs](https://day.js.org/), and styling
is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The package (not published to NPM btw) essentially has two exports:

- `useCalendar()`: Hook that handles all the logic. If you want to style this
  your own way, you can use this hook without importing the `Calendar`
  components.
- `Calendar`: Consist of three "compound components":
  - `<Calendar.CalendarActions />`: Showing the calendar title and the buttons
    for navigating between months.
  - `<Calendar.CalendarHeader />`: The top list of days (Monday-Sunday)
  - `<Calendar.CalendarGrid />`: Showing the currently selected months, and it's
    days.

Here's a minimal code example of how it's used:

```js
const CalendarDemo = () => {
  const [calendarState, calendarEvents] = useCalendar();
  const { currentDate, days } = calendarState;

  return (
    <div className="">
      <div className="text-center">
        <Calendar.CalendarActions
          className="mb-4"
          onNextMonth={calendarEvents.handleNextMonthClick}
          onPrevMonth={calendarEvents.handlePreviousMonthClick}
        >
          {currentDate.format('MMMM YYYY')}
        </Calendar.CalendarActions>
        <Calendar.CalendarHeader daysToRender={days} />
      </div>
      <Calendar.CalendarGrid
        onClick={calendarEvents.handleDateClick}
        selectionStart={calendarState.selectionStart}
        selectionEnd={calendarState.selectionEnd}
        selectedMonth={currentDate.month()}
        daysToRender={days}
      />
    </div>
}
```

I'll probably go more in-depth about it's API and how it's built in the future,
but for now I just wanted to show this off to the world üåç.

If you want to take a look at the source code, [you'll find that on
