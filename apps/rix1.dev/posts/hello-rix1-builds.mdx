Tired of copy-pasting content and components (and setup) between different
repos, I decided to restructure how my hobby projects were organized.

I've been setting up a Turborepo and started migrating
[rix1/relativity](https://github.com/rix1/relativity) (this site) over.

This is also the place I'm building
[FlowWriter](https://twitter.com/rix1/status/1510736583154147330), although
that's not live at the time of writing (2022-05-22 Sunday at 23:51).

In this short post, I just thought I'd share (and document) how I've set up
Prettier and Tailwind in this project. I went through a couple of iterations
before I felt happy with my setup, so hopefully others have to go through the
hoops as I did.

## Problem statement

In `./packages/config/` I've defined all eslint, prettier and tailwind config.
When setting up a new submodule, I install the following packages:

- eslint
- typescript
- tailwind (if the module is using that)

So far, it seems I don't have to install Prettier.

Since Tailwind has a Prettier plugin I decided to create a separate
`prettier.tailwind.config.js` file that deals with requring this plugin. For the
plugin to work, we need to reference the Tailwind config:

```js
// File: packages/config/prettier.tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  printWidth: 80,
  singleQuote: true,
  trailingComma: 'all',
  bracketSpacing: true,
  tailwindConfig: 'tailwind.config.js',
  plugins: [require('prettier-plugin-tailwindcss')],
};
```

I ran into some issues with realive file paths when you require, import or
extend these configurations. So I found that it was best to define the
configuration files in the submodule. These files often just require the proper
configuration file. This worked better across IDE and CLI instead of relying on
relative paths (e.g. `../../config/prettier.config.js`).

See for example how `.eslintrc.js` is defined in a given submodule:

```js
module.exports = require('config/eslint-preset');
```

Btw, all of this require that you have the configuration package listed as a
dependency in `package.json`. This is fairly simple with Turborepo:

```js
// package.json
"devDependencies": {
  "config": "workspace:*",
}
```

## Rules

1. Prefer shared configuration. Extend, import or reference other files as
   presets as much as possible.
2. Institutionalize scripts. Keep the same scripts across apps.
3. Test and ensure that IDE and command line scripts use the same configuration.
   This means to throw a `--verbose` or `--loglevel debug` flag on your CLI
   commands, as well as checking the output from your editor integration.

## Scripts I enjoy having around

Each submodule's `package.json` I'm defining the following scripts

```json
"lint": "next lint",
"check-types": "tsc --noemit",
"prettier": "prettier --check . --config ./prettier.config.js --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore",
"test": "pnpm prettier && pnpm lint && pnpm check-types"
```

Yes, I know test doesn't actually run any tests... But I like having one command
that I can run on pre-push or on CI to ensure at least _something_ is working.

Notice the `--config ./prettier.config.js` flag. It took me some time to realize
that Prettier CLI prefers default options (CLI arguments) over configuration
files. This caused inconsistent formatting between my IDE (vscode) and the `npm script`.

With the `--config` flag, I ensure that the same configuration is used across my
IDE and CLI.
