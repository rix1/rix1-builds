Tired of copy-pasting content and components (and setup) between different
repos, I decided to restructure how my hobby projects were organized.

I've been setting up a [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) and started migrating
[rix1/relativity](https://github.com/rix1/relativity) (this site) over.

This is also the place I'm building
[FlowWriter](https://twitter.com/rix1/status/1510736583154147330), although
that's not live at the time of writing (2022-05-22 Sunday at 23:51).

In this short post, I just thought I'd share (and document) how I've set up
Prettier, ESlint, Tailwind and Typescript in this monorepo. I went through a
couple of iterations before I felt happy with my setup, so hopefully others have
to go through the hoops as I did.

In any case, I want to use this as a reference for future-rix to remember what
the hell I was thinking.

### Setting up a new app

In `./packages/config/` I've defined shared configurations for ESlint, Prettier,
Tailwind and TypeScript. When setting up a new submodule, I should only need to
install `typescript`, and add two new entries to my package.json:

```json
// File: package.json
"devDependencies": {
  "config": "workspace:*",
  "tsconfig": "workspace:*",
}
```

Notice how I _don't_ install Tailwind, ESlint nor Prettier in the submodules.
This is all extended from `config/`. Next, I need to create a couple of files:

```sh
cd apps/new-app/

# Required for tailwind
touch postcss.config.js
touch tailwind.config.js

# Prettier & ESlint
touch prettier.config.js
touch .eslintrc.js

# TypeScript
touch tsconfig.json # If it doesn't exsist already
```

Depending on the type of configuration file, they can either be extended or they
simply reference the template file I have in `/packages/config/`.

Let's look examples for each of them:

**postcss.config.js**

After testing out a few combinations, it looks like I don't need this file for
the app to build Tailwind classes during production build (`pnpm run build`).
However, we need it for local development:

```js
// File: apps/new-app/postcss.config.js
module.exports = require('config/postcss.config');
```

**tailwind.config.js**

For Tailwind we can leverage the `presets` key, so the file looks like this:

```js
// File: apps/new-app/tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  presets: [require('config/tailwind.config')],
};
```

**prettier.config.js**

Because Tailwind have a Prettier plugin (for sorting class names), you need to
deceide which configuration file you want to reference:

```js
// File: apps/new-app/prettier.config.js
module.exports = require('config/prettier.config');
// or
module.exports = require('config/prettier.tailwind.config.js');
```

I'm still a bit on the fence about wheather I like the class name sorting or
not. It has the benefit of consistency, but it's a bit cumbersome that class
names jump around when saving. Especially when testing out different variants.

Also, it's obviously not working when using `clsx()` to concatinate class names.

For reference, the `prettier.tailwind.config.js` file adds the following two
properties:

```js
// File: packages/config/prettier.tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... default config
  tailwindConfig: 'tailwind.config.js',
  plugins: [require('prettier-plugin-tailwindcss')],
};
```

**Note:** It's important that you actually reference this file in your
`package.json`, if you might experience inconsistencies in formatting between
your IDE and when running the CLI. See [Testing the configuration](#testing-the-configuration) section below.

**.eslintrc.js**

I couldn't figure out how to properly use the `extends` key, so I'm simply just
referencing the shared configuration file like this:

```js
// File: apps/new-app/.eslintrc.js
module.exports = require('config/eslint-config');
```

### Testing the configuration

To test that everything works, I suggest you add a few scripts to the
submodule's `package.json`. The following are all standard across my apps:

```json
// File: apps/new-app/package.json
"scripts": {
  // ... other scripts
  "lint": "eslint . --cache",
  "ts": "tsc --noemit",
  "prettier": "prettier --check . --config ./prettier.config.js --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore",
  "test": "pnpm prettier && pnpm eslint && pnpm ts"
}

```

A couple of things to note here:

1. The ESlint script is named `lint` so that Turborepo will use the correct
   script when running `turbo run lint`.
2. I also have a shared .prettierignore at the root level of the Turborepo. And
   yes, I know test doesn't actually run any tests... But I like having one command
   that I can run on pre-push or on CI to ensure at least _something_ is working.
3. Notice the `--config ./prettier.config.js` flag. It took me some time to
   realize that Prettier CLI prefers default options (CLI arguments) over
   configuration files. This caused inconsistent formatting between my IDE (vscode)
   and the `npm script`. With the `--config` flag, I ensure that the same
   configuration is used across my IDE and CLI.

### Bringing it all together

In the top level `package.json`, we can now define some scripts to ensure our
entire code base is formatted correctly and follow a consistent code style:

```JSON
// File
"scripts": {
  // ...other scripts
  "lint": "turbo run lint",
  "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,md}\""
}
```

These two will run on all sub-modules and Turborepo will cache the results (at least of lint).

Some rules have emerged as I've configured this:

1. Prefer shared configuration. Extend, import or reference other files as
   presets as much as possible.
2. Institutionalize scripts. Keep the same scripts across apps.
3. Test and ensure that IDE and CLI use the same configuration. This might not
   be the case, which will lead to a lot of confusion. To ensure this, I suggest
   throwing a `--verbose` or `--loglevel debug` flag on your CLI commands, as
   well as checking the output from your editor integration (e.g. VScode has a
   separate tab for Prettier output)

That's it for now! Hope you find this useful in the future Rix1 ðŸ‘‹
